 it can be used to provide guidance for observational system designs, and is promising for real-time probabilistic flood and drought forecasting [SHI 2014 | WATER RESOUR. RES. | 251]
 nonetheless, all products show large dissimilarities during conditions of water stress and drought and deficiencies in the way evaporation is partitioned into its different components [MIRALLES 2016 | HYDROL. EARTH SYST. SCI. | 231]
 this article presents a soil moisture osse that employs simulated l-band measurements and assesses its utility toward improving drought and flood risk estimates using the nasa land information system (lis) [KUMAR 2014 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 8]
 the results suggest that the improvements in surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and total runoff fields obtained through the assimilation of l-band measurements are effective in providing improvements in the drought and flood risk assessments as well [KUMAR 2014 | J. HYDROMETEOROL. | 8]
in this study, the climate teleconnections with meteorological droughts are analysed and used to develop ensemble drought prediction models using a support vector machine (svm)-copula approach over western rajasthan (india) [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 the meteorological droughts are identified using the standardized precipitation index (spi) [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 in the analysis of large-scale climate forcing represented by climate indices such as el nino southern oscillation, indian ocean dipole mode and atlantic multidecadal oscillation on regional droughts, it is found that regional droughts exhibits interannual as well as interdecadal variability [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 on the basis of potential teleconnections between regional droughts and climate indices, spi-based drought forecasting models are developed with up to 3months' lead time [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 as traditional statistical forecast models are unable to capture nonlinearity and nonstationarity associated with drought forecasts, a machine learning technique, namely, support vector regression (svr), is adopted to forecast the drought index, and the copula method is used to model the joint distribution of observed and predicted drought index [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 the copula-based conditional distribution of an observed drought index conditioned on predicted drought index is utilized to simulate ensembles of drought forecasts [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 two variants of drought forecast models are developed, namely a single model for all the periods in a year and separate models for each of the four seasons in a year [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 the performance of developed models is validated for predicting drought time series for 10 years' data [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 improvement in ensemble prediction of drought indices is observed for combined seasonal model over the single model without seasonal partitions [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 8]
 the results show that the proposed svm-copula approach improves the drought prediction capability and provides estimation of uncertainty associated with drought predictions [GANGULI 2014 | HYDROL. PROCESS. | 81]
droughts are complex hydro-meteorological phenomena, which are challenging to both quantify and predict [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 from the perspective of drought quantification, knowledge of the land surface conditions is vital for determining the impacts a drought event is having on both the environment and society [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 although such land surface information is essential for quantifying drought in real-time, the precise effect of land surface moisture deficits on future drought conditions is unknown [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 forecasting of recovery from drought events is undoubtedly reliant on its intensity, yet the lead time at which a drought can be expected to recover is poorly understood [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 due to this gap in knowledge, this study attempts to quantify the expected lead time for drought recovery, and the rate of drought recovery, by examining the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions within a climatological forecast [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 from this perspective, the expected recovery time from a specific drought event is quantified, based on a case study in the upper colorado river basin in southwestern usa for two initialization dates in years 2003 through 2008 [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 this study has ramifications for understanding the time of drought recovery, and highlights the importance of accurate land surface state estimation [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 with respect to recent studies, the experiments presented here suggest that forecasts can be sensitive to initial conditions at greater lead-times, and therefore drought conditions are potentially more persistent than previously thought [DECHANT 2015 | J. HYDROL. | 6]
 most of the agricultural surface areas of the heterogeneous swiss rhone catchment are already exposed to drought [SMITH 2014 | CLIM. CHANGE | 2]
 nevertheless, in some areas of southern finland, wheat production will face increasing risk of high temperature and drought, which can offset the benefits of climate change on wheat yield, resulting in an increase in yield variability and about 30\% probability of yield decrease for spring wheat [TAO 2015 | CLIM. RES. | 1]
 our study explicitly para meterized the effects of extreme temperature and drought stress on wheat yields, and accounted for a wide range of wheat cultivars with contrasting phenological characteristics and thermal requirements [TAO 2015 | CLIM. RES. | 11]
 the evapotranspiration (et) affects the agriculture production, and it is very important in areas affected by water scarcity and droughts [OLMOS 2014 | NA | 0]
